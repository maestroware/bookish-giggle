            <h1>Story</h1>
            <p>At age of 40, being mother of 2 lovely & active kids, husband having a respectable career & earning, and I being fully satisfied for almost ten years just managing home … this lifestyle can be easily predicted as “going into nowhere hereafter” for most woman in India. I had also got a bit overweight, an after-effect of 2 deliveries thru c-section. Most people adjust to this also for rest of their lives. But that’s when I decided to change the situation – first for myself, then for my family & finally it has now become a passion to bring goodness to society.
                Certified Yoga Teacher from The Yoga Guru ,Bharti Vidya Bhawan and MA in Yog Science. Now I am working as a professional Lifestyle Consultant and associated with Jagriti Leela Foundation, an NGO working among underprivileged children in govt schools, providing resources and organising awareness camps. I am conducting Yoga classes daily for all Professionals being IT , Teacher ,Kids etc. Basically I want people to recognize importance of healthy lifestyle & then I help them adopt it with a combination of Yoga, meditation, diet & nutrition.As I see a lot of people, mainly ladies, in my own social circle, struggling with the same kind of lifestyle problems, worrying for the well-being of their families, wondering about their own future and health, so now I am devoted to helping others in achieving this Positive Transformation, in my own small ways. Within 2-3 months many girls ,women, men with severe lifestyle related problems have started feeling the positive changes & their happiness is my best reward. I strongly believe that we must correct our lifestyle rather than run after medicines. I am constantly spreading this message & every happy client is adding to this message.
                From being a happy-go-lucky housewife, to a busy professional Health Consultant, is a transformation I am truly proud of. I do my work with passion to build a healthy society & I am confident one day our dream of fit India would be realized by following the wisdom of our ancient culture. Jai Hind!!
